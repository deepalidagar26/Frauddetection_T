# Frauddetection_T
A fraud detection model in machine learning (ML) is a predictive model that aims to identify fraudulent activities or anomalies within a given dataset. The concept behind fraud detection models is to utilize historical data containing both fraudulent and legitimate instances to learn patterns and characteristics that differentiate fraudulent behaviour from normal behaviour.
The concept behind fraud detection models revolves around leveraging machine learning algorithms to automatically detect patterns, anomalies, or suspicious behaviours that may indicate fraudulent activity. By training the model on historical data, it can learn from past fraudulent instances and generalise to identify new instances of fraud. The goal is to minimise false positives (legitimate instances incorrectly labeled as fraud) while maximising the detection of actual fraud cases.
It's worth noting that fraud detection models are dynamic and need to adapt to evolving fraud techniques. Regular monitoring, model retraining, and continuous improvement are essential to ensure the model's effectiveness in identifying and preventing fraudulent activities.
